# SEG2102 Database Security & Integrity

This repository supports a qualitative and comparative study on database security and data integrity mechanisms in relational and NoSQL database management systems.

## Scope of Study
- Integrity constraints in relational DBMS
- Data integrity enforcement in NoSQL databases
- Access control mechanisms and least-privilege principles
- Comparison of theory and practical implementation based on the literature

## Purpose of the Code
The code provided in this repository serves as illustrative and verifiable examples to demonstrate how database security and integrity mechanisms are implemented in practice.

No performance benchmarking or experimental evaluation was conducted. The implementation aligns with the theoretical discussion presented in the report and supports the findings from existing academic literature.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (Relational DBMS concepts)
- MongoDB (NoSQL DBMS)
